<h1>Ken Chang</h1>
<h2>MD/PhD Candidate, Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology</h2>
<p>Ken grew up in New York City and attended college at Penn. After moving to Boston, he joined QTIM to explore his interests in neurooncology, imaging informatics, and automated methods. His current projects include lesion segmentation, radiogenomics, and deep learning techniques. Outside of lab, Ken enjoys bowling, ping pong, and bike riding. <a href="mailto:kenchang@mit.edu">Email</a>, <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-chang-4ab12023/>LinkedIn</a>, <a href=https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/user/3589141>Martinos Center Page</a>, <a href="#Top">Back to Top.</a></p>

<h1>James Brown</h1>
<h2>Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Martinos Center @ MGH</h2>
<p>James studied computer science and biomedical imaging at the University of Birmingham (UK). His interests include image registration, segmentation, shape analysis and deep learning. Outside of work he enjoys bouldering, playing board games and making noise on a guitar (and more recently, a ukulele).<a href="mailto:jbrown97@mgh.harvard.edu">Email</a>, <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-brown-a241138b/>LinkedIn</a>, <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-brown-a241138b/>Martinos Center Page</a>, <a href="#Top">Back to Top.</a></p>

<h1>Andrew Beers</h1>
<h2>Research Assistant, Martinos Center @ MGH</h2>
<p>Andrew studied icebergs, phytoplankton, and sustainable architecture for an Environmental Studies degree at Brown University, but then abandoned all of that to work on quantitative tumor imaging and deep learning at QTIM instead. Inside of the lab, he's interested in dynamic contrast MRI, comparing and benchmarking radiomics software, and creating open-source deep learning tools for the medical imaging filed. Outside of the lab, he volunteers at a local progressive bookstore, watches basketball, and hikes in the Adirondacks. <a href="mailto:abeers@mgh.harvard.edu">Email</a>, <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewlbeers/>LinkedIn</a>, <a href="#Top">Back to Top.</a></p>
