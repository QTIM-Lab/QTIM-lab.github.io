<h1>Ken Chang</h1>
<h2>PHD/MD Candidate, Harvard-MIT Health, Sciences, and Technology School</h2>
<p>Andrew studied iceberg movement, phytoplankton, and sustainable architecture for an Environmental Studies degree at Brown University, but then threw all of that away to work on quantitative tumor imaging and deep learning at QTIM instead. Inside of the lab, he's interested in dynamic contrast MRI, comparing and benchmarking radiomics software, and creating open-source deep learning tools for the medical imaging filed. Outside of the lab, he volunteers at a local progressive bookstore, watches basketball, and hikes in the Adirondacks. <a href="mailto:abeers@mgh.harvard.edu">Email</a>, <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewlbeers/>LinkedIn</a>, <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewlbeers/>Martinos Center Page</a>, <a href="#Top">Back to Top.</a></p>
